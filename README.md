1. **Floating Button**:

   - Button includes the Parados logo with inverted colors for better visibility.
2. **Popup**:
   - Opens an iframe-sized popup directly above the button.

## Troubleshooting

  - Ensure the script is correctly copied and pasted into the console.
  - Verify the form URL is accessible.
  - Check browser console errors for hints.
